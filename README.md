# Project_Portfolio

A brief portfolio of projects I have undertaken for both academic and personal development purposes.

# Engineering Projects 

## [Projectile Trajectory Optimization](https://github.com/seanwarner97/Project_Portfolio/tree/main/EngineeringProblems/ProjectileTrajectory)

Path of a projectile engineering project.

First portion uses Python to simulate the 2 dimensional trajectory of a particle with given initial imput conditions.

Second portion uses built in SciPy optimization packages to optimize input parameters of particle in order to hit a target at given coordinates.

Both gradient based and genetic optimization are utilised from SciPy and Matplotlib is used for all visualizations.

## [Turbulent Fluid Flow Pipe Losses](https://github.com/seanwarner97/Project_Portfolio/tree/main/EngineeringProblems/PressureLosses)

A short project using a Newton Raphson Itteration to resolve fluid flow problems that cannot be resolved analytically. 

Project takes input data with fluid/pipe properties and recorded fluid velocities, and then outputs losses due to friction and a Moody diagram for the fluid.

Matplotlib is used to create Moody diagrams.
